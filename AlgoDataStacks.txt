Stacks
Stack is an abstract data structure with two operations push(val) and pop(). push adds a new value at the
"top" of the stack, pop takes the value at the "top" of the stack.

CPU needs a register for the start and top so it doesn't need to many registers

What if top is greater then the size of the array? make it dynamic, make a larger array and send it to that one, don't allow it. But you always need to check the size. In c it overwrites what comes after in memory

3 4 + 2 4 + *
7 6 *
